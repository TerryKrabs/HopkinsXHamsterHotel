#Build a website based off the prototype
#Peer Reviewer : Jeriah Marson 4:30
#Peer Review: The a links dont function and not all pictures are centered and some back grounds are not the right color. The website is responsive and looks good as far as its different forms but none of them look exactly correct, there is for sure some improvments to be made but he got some of the important parts down ,but some important parts are missing such as ammenities and contacts but im sure he couldve gotten it down if he had prioritezed it because it looks like he was focusing on responsiveness the whole time while building.
