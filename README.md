//Hamster Hotel

//summary: I mostly used bootstrap componets and inline styling too create my Hamster Hotel. This was by far the hardest assignment that i've done up until this point. I focused a majority of my time time on trying to make the website responsive, because I figured that would be the only challenging part of this assignment. However, because of this I underestimated how much time it would take to code out the amenities/reserve a room portion of the website. Overall, I think I could have done alot better on this assignment if I prioritized the right things, but I gained a much better understanding of responsiveness and in line styling.

//Peer Review: The a links dont function and not all pictures are centered and some back grounds are not the right color. The website is responsive and looks good as far as its different forms but none of them look exactly correct, there is for sure some improvments to be made but he got some of the important parts down ,but some important parts are missing such as ammenities and contacts but im sure he couldve gotten it down if he had prioritezed it because it looks like he was focusing on responsiveness the whole time while building.
